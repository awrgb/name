Chapter 2: State Graphs: A Solution for Workflow Management

Artificial intelligence and machine learning workflows often involve a complex choreography of data preparation, model training, evaluation, and deployment. Managing these intricate processes effectively can be a significant challenge, especially as workflows scale in size and complexity.  This chapter introduces state graphs as a powerful solution for orchestrating and automating these workflows within the LangGraph framework. We'll explore how state graphs provide a structured and visually intuitive representation of workflows, enabling flexible decision-making, robust error handling, and dynamic task management. By the end of this chapter, readers will understand the fundamental concepts of state graphs and how they form the core of LangGraph's approach to building efficient, scalable, and maintainable AI/ML systems. This understanding will lay the groundwork for subsequent chapters, which delve deeper into specific LangGraph features and applications.
