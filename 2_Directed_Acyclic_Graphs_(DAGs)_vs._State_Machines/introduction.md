Chapter 2: Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) vs. State Machines

LangGraph leverages the power of state graphs to orchestrate complex AI/ML workflows, offering a robust mechanism for managing transitions, handling failures, and ensuring efficient execution. This chapter lays the groundwork for understanding LangGraph's core principles by comparing and contrasting two prominent graph structures: Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and state machines.  While both offer ways to represent and manage workflows, they differ significantly in their expressiveness and ability to handle dynamic behavior.  We will delve into the limitations of DAGs when dealing with scenarios requiring real-time adaptation and complex decision-making, highlighting the advantages of state machines in these contexts.  This comparison will clarify why LangGraph adopts a state-based approach, paving the way for a deeper exploration of its features and applications in subsequent chapters.
