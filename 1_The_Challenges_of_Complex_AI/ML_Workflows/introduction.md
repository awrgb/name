Chapter 1: The Challenges of Complex AI/ML Workflows

Artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) are transforming industries, driving innovation in areas ranging from autonomous vehicles to personalized medicine.  However, as AI/ML models become increasingly sophisticated, so too do the workflows required to build, train, deploy, and manage them. These workflows often involve a complex orchestration of data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, deployment, monitoring, and retraining, often with intricate dependencies and conditional logic.  Traditional approaches to managing these workflows can quickly become unwieldy, leading to brittle systems prone to errors, difficult to maintain, and challenging to scale. This chapter delves into the core challenges presented by these complex AI/ML workflows, setting the stage for how LangGraph and its state graph approach offer a robust and scalable solution. We will explore the limitations of existing workflow management techniques and highlight the need for a more flexible and dynamic approach, paving the way for the introduction of LangGraph in subsequent chapters.
