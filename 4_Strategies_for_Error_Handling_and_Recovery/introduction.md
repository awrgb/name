Chapter 4: 4 Strategies for Error Handling and Recovery

AI and machine learning workflows are inherently prone to disruptions.  From data inconsistencies and model training failures to unexpected infrastructure issues, robust error handling is critical for ensuring reliable and resilient operation.  This chapter dives into the core of error management within the LangGraph framework, outlining four key strategies for handling and recovering from errors within state graph-driven workflows. Building upon the foundational concepts introduced in previous chapters, we'll explore how LangGraph empowers developers to anticipate, detect, and respond to errors effectively. This includes techniques for implementing retry mechanisms, fallback pathways, and sophisticated error analysis, allowing you to build AI systems that gracefully handle unforeseen challenges and maintain operational integrity.  By the end of this chapter, you'll be equipped to design robust and fault-tolerant LangGraph workflows, maximizing the stability and reliability of your AI and machine learning pipelines.
